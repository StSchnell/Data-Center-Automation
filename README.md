# Data Center Automation

In a data center, configuration and change processes cause a high proportion of the operating costs. Therefore it is worth automating IT processes in a data center infrastructure. This reduces the number of errors, simplifies the service configuration and increases their availability. This makes it possible to respond much more flexibly to new business requirements and to provide services more quickly.

## VMware Aria Automation

VMware Aria is a management platform that offers consistent handling of applications, infrastructures and services across different kind of clouds with a single common data model. A part of it is [VMware Aria Automation](https://www.vmware.com/products/aria-automation.html), a workflow automation platform with which complex data center infrastructure tasks can be automated or extended.

### Rhino

The [Rhino](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino) JavaScript engine is part of VMware Aria Automation runtime environments. It is programmed in Java and generates a class from the compiled JavaScript code. It was bundled with Java SE 6 and used as a programming interface in some business products, like VMware Aria Automation. Rhino can be used with Java 8 and above and is mostly compatible with the ECMAScript 5 standard.

It is possible to use [JavaScript](JavaScriptLibraries.md) libraries with VMware Aria Automation in the context of the runtime environment with the Rhino engine.
